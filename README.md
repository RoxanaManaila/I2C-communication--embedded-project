# I2C-communication--embedded-project
This project is developed in TinkerCAD, and it focuses on the I2C (TWI) communication
between 3 microcontrollers. The hardware is composed of one master device and two slave devices and
the main idea of the project is sending and receving data between the master and the other two devices.
What is special about this project is that the code itself is written using only Atmega328P registers.
